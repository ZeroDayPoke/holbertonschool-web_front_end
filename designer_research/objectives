Learning objectives
Understand how designers work by:

solving a UX problem;
writing a UX case study that explains your discoveries.
Be creative. You will not be evaluated on the success or feasibility of the final solution, but on how you have solved the initial problem, by writing a design case study that communicates each step of the process and what you have learned/discovered.

Here is a template to help you with the structure
To achieve this, you will follow the tasks below. Along the way, you will gather pieces of content that should give you enough substance to write your story.
Make sure to include any photo of your notes, sketches (paper or whiteboard) and paper prototypes! You are also encouraged to include the materials provided by the research team in your case study.
