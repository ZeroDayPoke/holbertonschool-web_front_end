One project, 3 parts
This project is split in 3 parts:

Research: this one, where you will get familiar with these 3 personas, UX problems and starting to think about solutions
Prototype: put in Figma your thinking prototypes
Validate: share your work with other users/students and get feedback on it
The final result will be a blog post, posted in LinkedIn and/or Medium, that you will add more contents during each part.
