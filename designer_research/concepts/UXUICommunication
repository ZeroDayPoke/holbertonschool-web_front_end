UI/UX - Communicating your needs and giving constructive feedback
Giving feedback and asking questions to your peer designers is always welcomed! And you should also remember to trust their expertise.

When you are asked to give feedback on designs, usually they are seeking for:

Your knowledge in terms of technical limitations;
Your opinion on the usability or interaction. You are potentially a user too;
Your point of view on the cohesion and feasibility of the UI;
And if something is not clear regarding the implementation, make sure to clarify it as soon as possible.
Examples of useful vs. non-constructive feedback:
On colors:
✘ “I don’t like this purple!”

Colors are hard to pick and everyone sees them differently. Plus, telling that you don’t like it doesn’t help, maybe elaborate by telling why this color bothers you. If you cannot express it, don’t waste your energy to communicate this. If it bothers you because, for example, you can hardly read the text, it’s a precious feedback to give so try this instead:

✔︎ “I am having a hard time reading the links. Maybe the contrast is not strong enough, what do you think?”

On user interface:
✘ “Why did you do this? It’s doesn’t make any sense.”

If you can spot an inconsistent pattern in the usage of a UI component, try to say:

✔︎ “Hey, I have noticed that you were using different styles for buttons that have negative actions. Was it intended?”

General:
✘ “I can’t do this, this is not realistic!”

Try to express why. It helps them to understand and moreover they will stop suggesting it in the future. Also, try to look for a solution before stating that you can not achieve it.

✘ “I dunno, I just don’t like it.”

Your opinion matters only if it’s constructive, so please, if you want your voice to be heard, explain what and why you don’t like in their designs. Also keep in mind that aesthetic is purely subjective.
