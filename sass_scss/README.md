# Holberton School Web Front End - Sass/SCSS Project

## Description

This project is focused on demonstrating the capabilities of Sass/SCSS, a powerful CSS preprocessor that adds functionality like variables, nesting, mixins, and more to standard CSS. The project includes various examples of these features, showing how they can be used to write more maintainable and readable stylesheets.

## Files

- `0-debug_log.scss`: Demonstrates the use of the `@debug` directive.
- `1-color_variable.scss`: Introduces a color variable and applies it to body and paragraph tags.
- `2-color_variables.scss`: Defines multiple color variables and applies them to various elements.
- `3-nested_tag.scss`: Showcases nested syntax in SCSS for tags.
- `4-nested_class.scss`: Illustrates nested syntax within classes.
- `5-nested_child.scss`: Demonstrates child selector nesting in SCSS.
- `6-nested_hover.scss`: Uses nested syntax for pseudo-classes like `:hover`.
- `7-nested_deeper.scss`: Explores deeper levels of nesting within SCSS.
- `8-mixin_margins.scss`: Defines a mixin for margins and applies it to different elements.
- `9-extend_list.scss`: Shows how to use the `@extend` directive to share styles between selectors.
- `10-import_colors.scss`: Uses the `@import` directive to include color variables from another file.
- `10-colors.scss`: Defines a set of color variables for use across stylesheets.
- `11-loop_photos.scss`: Demonstrates the use of `@each` loop with a list of photo names.
- `11-photos.scss`: Contains a list of names used in the `11-loop_photos.scss`.
- `12-loop_header.scss`: Uses the `@for` loop to create dynamic styles for headers.
