# CSS Advanced

This directory contains various CSS files added to the Holberton School version 2 curriculum. I completed this project in anticipation of helping newer students overcome any issues that they might encounter while working as a tutor for Holberton.

## File Descriptions

- [32-style.css](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-web_front_end/blob/main/CSS_advanced/32-style.css): Part 32 of 32. Parts 1 thru 31 exist in this directory, but as I recall were esentially precursors to this finished style.
