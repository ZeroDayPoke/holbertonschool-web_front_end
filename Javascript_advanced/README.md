# Holberton School Web Front End - JavaScript Advanced Project

## Project Description

This project is focused on advanced JavaScript concepts, including lexical scoping, closures, binding, callbacks, and the execution stack. It demonstrates the practical application of these concepts through a series of JavaScript exercises, each highlighting a specific aspect of advanced JavaScript techniques.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, students are expected to understand:

- Lexical scoping in JavaScript.
- The concept and application of closures in JavaScript.
- How to effectively use closure and chain closures.
- Simulating private methods using closures.
- Understanding the execution stack order in JavaScript.
- Utilizing binding in JavaScript functions.
- Implementing callbacks for asynchronous operations.

## JavaScript Files and Their Functionality

### 1. Nested Functions

- **File**: `1-nested_functions.js`
- Demonstrates nested functions and lexical scoping.

### 2. Function Me

- **File**: `2-function_me.js`
- Implements closures to create personalized welcome messages.

### 3. Classrooms

- **File**: `3-classrooms.js`
- Uses closures to create a function that assigns students to seats in a classroom.

### 4. Math Operations

- **File**: `4-math.js`
- Illustrates closures for creating functions to perform arithmetic operations.

### 5. Mode

- **File**: `5-mode.js`
- Demonstrates the use of closures to change the styling mode of a webpage.

### 6. Hogwarts

- **File**: `6-hogwarts.js`
- Simulates private methods using closures in a student scoring system.

### 7. Timeout

- **File**: `7-timeout.js`
- Shows the execution stack order with `setTimeout` and a loop.

### 8. Payments

- **File**: `8-payments.js`
- Provides an example of function chaining in order processing.

### 9. Prime Numbers

- **File**: `9-prime.js`
- Implements a prime number checker and uses performance measurement.

### 10. Calculating Prime Numbers

- **File**: `10-prime.js`
- Enhances the prime number calculation with repetitive execution for performance analysis.

### 11. Prime Numbers with Timeout

- **File**: `11-prime.js`
- Optimizes prime number calculation by using `setTimeout`.

### 12. Room Area

- **File**: `12-room_area.js`
- Demonstrates the use of `bind` to set the `this` context in an object method.

### 13. Binding a User

- **File**: `13-bind_user.js`
- Uses `bind` to attach a user object to a function.

### 14. Wikipedia Query

- **File**: `14-wikipedia.js`
- Implements an XMLHttpRequest to fetch data from Wikipedia using a callback.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open each `.js` file in a JavaScript runtime environment or a browser console to see the output.
